# Python Learning Examples

Welcome to the Python Learning Examples repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice Python by working on various programming tasks. The examples provided cover a range of topics, and each task comes with an empty file for you to attempt on your own. If you get stuck or want to check your solution, there is a corresponding file with a "(solved)" suffix.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.9.12 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Run

To run a script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Type the following command to run a script, replacing `xxxx` with the name of the script:
   ```bash
   python xxxx
   ```
For example, to run "weather.py", use:

```bash
python weather.py
```

# Python Scripts and Descriptions
(these scripts are in to_solve for you to implement should you need help with the basics, like really really basic stuff)
- weather.py: Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- days.py: Calculates and prints the number of minutes in a year.
- sphere.py: Takes the radius of a sphere as input and outputs the sphere's diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume.
- palindrome.py: Determines whether a four-letter word provided by the user is a palindrome.
- demorgan.py: Visual representation of De Morgan's theorem.
- letter_grade.py: Gets a numerical score from the user (0 to 100) and prints a corresponding letter grade based on the provided grading scale.

# Important Note
This repository is not intended to be your first attempt at Python. It is designed to help you brush up on your skills or challenge your understanding of programming concepts. However, if you still wish to learn python from doing, then solve the scripts in to_solve, becuse these have the most helpful comments. 

Happy coding!
